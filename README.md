# HangmanGame
Hangman game written in C#

## Current state of the game
As for now ( 5.05.2022 ) game is not fully working - I copied it from may local machine ( where it is working ) and therefore I need to make some changes like:

- refactor files that the code is using to allow it to work if you download in on some other machine
- change names to make it in English
- add more comments and make it clear to anyone who open it
